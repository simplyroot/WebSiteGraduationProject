# GraduationProject
In this project I'll be making a personal website for the game I made on OOB lesson project. I'll use all the information (MVC) that I learned in the ASP.Net lesson. The website is going to be like a commercial site of my games. First I'll introduce myself than my game on the website. (These both will be more than 1 page). In the end it will be a professional website so I can show my projects to other.
